If you don't know much about pull request, you can read [the Github article](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).



Pull requests Guidelines
----------

Pull requests are highly appreciated. Here are some guidelines to help:

1. **Solve a problem**. Features are great, but even better is cleaning-up and fixing issues.
2. **Add an example** or **write tests**. This helps preserve functionality as the codebase grows.
3. **Small > Big**. Better to have a few small PRs that address specific parts of the code.



Pull requests Workflow
----------

1. Fork the library repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **gh-pages** branch
